    <h2>What is Heart Place with Nurse Jacqui</h2>
    <p>Jacqui has been an experienced registered Nurse supporting those in health psychology and whole health medicine. With over 27 years experience, Jacqui has experienced supporting families to achieve full health. Jacqui’s focus is to empower those in caring roles; our carers and our future carers, to help them develop healthy strategies and focus on their health and quality of life while focussing on what they love. 
    </p>                     
    <p>Heart Place with Nurse Jacqui uses the whole heart medicine institute’s 6 steps of healing by Lissa Rankin MD. She also mentors our young carers via her Care-Full group. In her Care-Full group she teaches our young carers how to be resilient, create self care practices that support their mental health well-being, believing in ourselves and showing self worth. Nurse Jacqui is also reminding us that “We need to be mindful of the mental and physical health of those we are asking to support the mental and physical health of our nation”
    
    </p>
    <p>Jacqui’s real passion lies in creating Heart Place Hospital, a center (rural based) where health professionals and others can replenish, recharge and reconnect. With funding available, Jacqui can offer support to those who need it. Jacqui is asking the community to look around them, take note of who needs help and suggest that those in need, feel not afraid to reach out for help, as there is help available all around them.
