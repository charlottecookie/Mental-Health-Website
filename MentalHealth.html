<p>If you have poor mental health, you might find that the way you're thinking, feeling or acting becomes difficult to cope with. You might not enjoy things you used to like doing. You might also feel sad or angry for a longer time than usual. You might also feel like you can't control how you feel or behave.</p>

<h4> What are mental health problems?</h4>
<p>A mental health problem is when 
<b>the way you're thinking, feeling or acting becomes difficult for you to cope with.</b>
</p>
<p>We can all feel sad, worried, angry, or fed up at times, like nerves before an exam or feeling down when a friend moves away. But if these feelings last a long time,  like if you   always feel low or can't sleep, it might be a sign that you need more help. For example, if the way you feel:</p>
<p>affects you most days</p>
<p>stops you from doing the things you enjoy</p>
<p>makes you feel like you can't cope anymore</p>


<p> Mental health problems are very common and they are not a sign of weakness and can happen to anyone. People can experience mental health problems differently, too. 

<p> There are many different types of mental health problems and they all have their own unique names. For example, depression, anorexia, panic attacks, ADHD, and anxiety. </p>

<p>There are a bunch of reasons that might cause mental health problems. Sometimes it might be a few different things that have bulit up, like:</p>
<p>problems at home, school or in realtionships</p>
<p>big changes in your life</p>
